Predicting future values of various financial data holds great importance for diverse business applications. However, these financial datasets often exhibit a high degree of non-linearity and non-stationarity, posing challenges to the accuracy of predictive models. Employing the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm for pre-processing raw data has shown promising results in enhancing predictive model accuracy.

This paper introduces a hybrid approach that incorporates EMD before applying predictive models to forecast one-step future stock values of Apple Inc. Various models, including the feed-forward neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gaussian Process Regression (GP), have been explored as potential predictive models in this study.
